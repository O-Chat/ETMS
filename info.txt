🎯 Now, Frontend Phase: Goals

You want:

    A city grid (10x10) visual map.

    Show vehicle locations live.

    Allow users to submit emergency requests via a form.

    Highlight dispatched vehicle paths.

    Show dispatch result in UI (what’s in output.json).

🔧 Suggested Flow:

    [Frontend] City Grid UI

        Render a 10x10 grid using React.

        Highlight locations like Sector47, Sector58, etc.

        Show vehicles (🟢 for available, 🔴 for busy).

    [Frontend] Request Form

        Fields: Name, Age, Location, Urgency, Type (Medical/Fire/Crime).

        On submit, generate a new incoming_request.json.

    [Backend Node]

        On receiving a form submission:

            Write incoming_request.json.

            Spawn your compiled C++ executable.

            Wait for it to generate output.json.

            Read and send response back to React.

    [Frontend] Show Result

        Show which vehicle was dispatched, to where.

        Update the vehicle’s position on the map.

        Optional: store a dispatch log.

        🧠 Which should be built first?

👉 Start with the Node.js backend, because:

    It's the bridge between your React frontend and the C++ system.

    You need it to:

        Accept form data from the frontend.

        Write it to incoming_request.json.

        Run your compiled C++ code (your logic).

        Read the result from output.json and return it to the frontend.

Once this is ready, your frontend can just send requests and display results.
✅ Which is easier?

    Node.js backend is simpler and quicker to write.

    No UI, no styling.

    Just basic file I/O and process management.

You already have the logic in C++, so all Node needs to do is:

    Save JSON.

    Run .exe (or Linux binary).

    Send back result.

    📍 So let’s begin with:

✅ A simple Node.js server that:

    Accepts a request,

    Saves it to incoming_request.json,

    Runs your C++ code,

    Returns output.json content.
